RobotHaikubot is a twitter bot built by Ben Perisot (@BenPerisot), Marty Martinez (@Marty42Martinez), Chris Lu (@ChrisLuPDX), Cheri Portman (@CheriPortman), and Emily Baier (@maybeemily). This project was built for our mid-term project at Alchemy Code Lab.

RobotHaikubot, upon being tweeted at, sends a random haiku composed of lines stored in a database. You can also add a hashtag to your request - #positive, #negative, or #neutral - to receive a haiku of that sentiment. No hashtag simply means to send a basic, random haiku.

Initial lines were crafted by our team; additional lines were sourced from twitter users and fellow students.

The lines are evaluated for sentiment and syllable count when added to the database.
